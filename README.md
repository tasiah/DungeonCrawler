# Dungeon Crawler
- My favorite personal project!
- Designed and implemented a text-based dungeon crawler in which the player blindly navigates a randomly-generated maze and battles randomly-moving monsters
- Incorporated functionality to allow user to define maze size and scale number of monsters proportionally
